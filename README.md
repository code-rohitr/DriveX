This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

# Features

- **File Upload & Analysis**: Users can upload **XLSX files** (Excel spreadsheets), which are then processed and analyzed using the selected LLM (GPT-4 or Gemini). The content of the file, including data, columns, and sheets, is extracted and summarized for the user.
  
- **Two Methods of Chat**:
  - **GPT-4**: Uses a **single-answer approach** to respond to user queries. The user submits a question, and GPT-4 provides a comprehensive, single response, ideal for quick insights or concise answers.
  - **Gemini**: Implements a **chat-based Q&A** format. Users can engage in a back-and-forth conversation, asking multiple questions, and receiving contextually aware responses that build on previous interactions. This method is suitable for more detailed and interactive dialogues.

With these features, users can easily analyze Excel data and interact with two of the most advanced LLMs available, tailored to their preferences.

### The app demonstrates the integration of two LLMs: GPT-4 and Gemini

This project integrates two powerful language models, **GPT-4** from OpenAI and **Gemini** from Google. These models allow the application to perform advanced natural language processing tasks, such as document summarization, question answering, and content generation.

- **GPT-4**: A highly advanced language model developed by OpenAI. GPT-4 excels at understanding and generating human-like text, and can be applied to a wide range of tasks, from answering complex questions to creative writing.
  - **Link to OpenAI API**: [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs)
  - **Link to GPT-4 Documentation**: [GPT-4 Overview](https://openai.com/research/gpt-4)

- **Gemini**: Google's advanced language model, part of the Gemini family. It is built to provide high-quality text generation capabilities, and can be used for tasks similar to GPT-4 but with Google's proprietary enhancements.
  - **Link to Gemini API Documentation**: [Google Generative AI](https://developers.google.com/generative-ai)

By integrating these models, the app can provide users with intelligent document analysis, extract insights, and even generate helpful visualizations based on input data.

---
This project allows seamless interaction with both models, providing a versatile tool for analyzing and processing documents and other types of content.

# Usage Instructions

Follow these steps to upload and interact with the AI using an `.xlsx` file.

## Steps:

1. **Select the Model:**
   - Choose the LLM (Language Model) of your choice from the dropdown menu.

2. **Upload the File:**
   - Click on the "Select File" button and choose your `.xlsx` file.

3. **Automatic Upload:**
   - Once the file is selected, it will be uploaded automatically.

4. **Start the Conversation:**
   - After the file upload, you can chat with the AI about the contents of the document.

5. **Please wait if it loads:**
   - Depending upon the internet speed and other factors, the app might take longer than usual to return a response, Kindly be patient and allow to generate the response. If the response fails, resend the the prompt.
